# Verification Plan

This document outlines the steps to verify that the project remains stable and functional after the file cleanup operation. These commands should be run after applying the changes from the `chore/cleanup-structure` branch.

## 1. Install Dependencies

Ensure all dependencies are correctly installed.

```sh
npm install
```

## 2. Type Checking

Verify that there are no TypeScript errors and all types resolve correctly.

```sh
npm run type-check
```

**Expected Outcome:** The command should exit with code 0 and report no type errors.

## 3. Linting

Check for any code quality or style issues.

```sh
npm run lint
```

**Expected Outcome:** The command should exit with code 0, indicating no linting errors.

## 4. Run Tests

Execute the full test suite to ensure all existing functionality is still working as expected.

```sh
npm run test:run
```

**Expected Outcome:** All tests should pass.

## 5. Build Project

Ensure the project can be successfully built for production.

```sh
npm run build
```

**Expected Outcome:** The build process should complete without errors, generating the production assets in the `dist` directory.

## Summary

A successful verification requires all the above commands to execute without errors. This will provide high confidence that the removal of unused files did not introduce any regressions.
