# Arabic Screenplay Editor Enhancement Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the key enhancements made to the Arabic Screenplay Editor to properly handle the complex structure of Arabic screenplays as demonstrated in the provided JSON data.

## Key Enhancements

### 1. Expanded Action Verb List
- Increased the [ACTION_VERB_LIST](file:///h:\New folder (26)\arabic-screenplay-editor\src\ScreenplayEditor.tsx#L25-L25) from ~30 verbs to 60+ Arabic verbs
- Added verbs covering a wide range of actions, emotions, and character interactions
- This improves the detection of action lines vs. character lines

### 2. Improved Scene Header Pattern Recognition
- Enhanced the [sceneHeader3](file:///h:\New folder (26)\arabic-screenplay-editor\src\ScreenplayEditor.tsx#L57-L57) regex pattern to include specific locations:
  - "كهف المرايا"
  - "غرفة الكهف"
  - "الكهف"
- This ensures proper recognition of complex location names

### 3. Enhanced Scene Header Agent
- Completely rewrote the SceneHeaderAgent function to handle complex scene headers
- Added better handling for headers with multiple components separated by dashes
- Improved processing of scene headers like "مشهد 1 – ليل-داخلي"

### 4. Enhanced Character Line Detection
- Modified the [isCharacterLine](file:///h:\New folder (26)\arabic-screenplay-editor\src\ScreenplayEditor.tsx#L156-L192) function with:
  - Increased word count limit (from 5 to 7) to accommodate longer Arabic names
  - Special handling for Arabic character names that end with colons
  - Enhanced pattern matching for Arabic text structures
  - Better context-aware processing

### 5. Improved Action Line Detection
- Enhanced the [isLikelyAction](file:///h:\New folder (26)\arabic-screenplay-editor\src\ScreenplayEditor.tsx#L194-L234) function with:
  - Expanded action indicators list with 60+ Arabic verbs
  - Better handling of descriptive sentences
  - Improved detection of sentences without explicit action verbs but with descriptive content

### 6. Enhanced Paste Handling
- Improved the [handlePaste](file:///h:\New folder (26)\arabic-screenplay-editor\src\ScreenplayEditor.tsx#L544-L625) function with:
  - Better processing of complex scene header structures
  - Enhanced dialogue block handling
  - Improved context tracking during paste operations
  - Automatic removal of leading dashes from action lines
  - **NEW**: Post-processing to correct misclassified bullet-point character lines

## Test Files Created

6. [final-test.txt](file:///h:\New folder (26)\arabic-screenplay-editor\src\final-test.txt) - Complete 10-scene test

## Expected Results
These enhancements should result in:

1. Proper formatting of complex scene headers like "مشهد 1 – ليل-داخلي"
2. Correct identification of character lines, especially those ending with colons
3. Better classification of action lines like "تبتسم هند رغم الامها"
