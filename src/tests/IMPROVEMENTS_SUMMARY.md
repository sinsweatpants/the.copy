# Arabic Screenplay Editor - Improvements Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the enhancements made to the Arabic Screenplay Editor to properly handle the complex structure of Arabic screenplays as demonstrated in the provided JSON data.

## Key Improvements

### 1. Enhanced Action Verb List
- Expanded the [ACTION_VERB_LIST](file:///h:\New folder (26)\arabic-screenplay-editor\src\ScreenplayEditor.tsx#L25-L25) constant with 60+ Arabic verbs to better detect action lines
- Added verbs related to emotions, movement, dialogue, and character interactions

### 2. Improved Scene Header Pattern Recognition
- Enhanced [sceneHeader3](file:///h:\New folder (26)\arabic-screenplay-editor\src\ScreenplayEditor.tsx#L57-L57) regex pattern to include specific locations like "كهف المرايا" and "غرفة الكهف"
- Improved the SceneHeaderAgent function to handle complex scene headers with multiple components separated by dashes

### 3. Enhanced Character Line Detection
- Modified [isCharacterLine](file:///h:\New folder (26)\arabic-screenplay-editor\src\ScreenplayEditor.tsx#L156-L192) function to better recognize Arabic character names
- Added special handling for Arabic text patterns that end with colons
- Increased word count limit for character lines to accommodate longer Arabic names

### 4. Improved Action Line Detection
- Enhanced [isLikelyAction](file:///h:\New folder (26)\arabic-screenplay-editor\src\ScreenplayEditor.tsx#L194-L234) function with more comprehensive Arabic action indicators
- Added better handling for descriptive sentences without explicit action verbs

### 5. Enhanced Scene Header Processing
- Improved the SceneHeaderAgent function to properly format complex scene headers like "مشهد 1 – ليل-داخلي"
- Added better handling for scene headers with location information like "قصر المُشتكي – غرفة الكهف"

### 6. Improved Paste Handling
- Enhanced the [handlePaste](file:///h:\New folder (26)\arabic-screenplay-editor\src\ScreenplayEditor.tsx#L544-L625) function to better process complex scene header structures
- Added special handling for dialogue blocks to maintain proper context
- Added automatic removal of leading dashes from action lines
- **NEW**: Added post-processing to correct misclassified bullet-point character lines

## Test Files Created
1. [test-scenario.txt](file:///h:\New folder (26)\arabic-screenplay-editor\src\test-scenario.txt) - Basic test scenario
2. [comprehensive-test.txt](file:///h:\New folder (26)\arabic-screenplay-editor\src\comprehensive-test.txt) - Comprehensive test with all JSON structure elements
3. [json-structure-test.txt](file:///h:\New folder (26)\arabic-screenplay-editor\src\json-structure-test.txt) - Specific test targeting the exact JSON data patterns

## Expected Improvements
These enhancements should result in:

1. Proper formatting of complex scene headers with time and location information
2. Correct identification of character lines, especially those ending with colons
3. Better classification of action lines vs. character lines
4. Improved handling of Arabic text patterns and structures
5. More accurate formatting of dialogue blocks
