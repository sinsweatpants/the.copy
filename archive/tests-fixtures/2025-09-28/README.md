# Archived Test Fixtures

This directory contains test fixture files that were previously located in `src/tests/` but are no longer actively used in the CI/CD pipeline or automated testing.

## Purpose

These files were archived on 2025-09-28 as part of a project cleanup effort. They represent example test cases and data fixtures that may be useful for:
- Reference when creating new tests
- Historical analysis of test patterns
- Recovery in case of accidental deletion of similar files

## Note

These files can be safely deleted after a 14-day observation period if no issues arise and no team member requests their retention.
