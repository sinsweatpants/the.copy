# Project Archive

This directory contains archived files that are no longer actively used in the project but are preserved for historical reference or potential future use.

## Structure

- `legacy/` - Contains legacy versions of components that have been replaced
- `tests-fixtures/` - Contains test fixture files that are no longer actively used in CI/CD

## Guidelines

1. Files in this archive can be safely deleted after a 14-day observation period
2. Each subdirectory should contain a README.md explaining the purpose of archived files
3. When adding new archives, follow the date-based organization pattern (YYYY-MM-DD)
