# Arabic Screenplay Editor

A Vite + React + TypeScript application that delivers a production-ready writing environment tailored for Arabic screenwriters. The editor combines precise right-to-left formatting, a customizable drafting surface, and an ecosystem of AI-powered agents that assist with analysis, ideation, and polishing.

## Key Features

- **Arabic-first screenplay formatting** – Automatic styling for basmala, scene headers, action, dialogue, transitions, and parentheticals with precise RTL layout.
- **Productivity tooling** – Keyboard navigation between formats, rich text styling, search and replace, character renaming, statistics, and light/dark mode toggles.
- **Auto-save orchestration** – A dedicated manager that safely persists work and supports future integrations with remote storage.
- **Advanced search engine** – Regex-aware search/replace with whole-word and case-sensitivity options tuned for Arabic scripts.
- **AI assistance suite** – Modular agents that analyze rhythm, characters, tension, producibility, and more, plus creative generators and completion utilities.
- **Visual planning support** – Storyboard and beat sheet abstractions for connecting prose with cinematic planning artifacts.





## Architecture Overview

| Layer | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **UI Components** | React components under `src/components/` implement the editor shell, modal dialogs, and UX tooling. |
| **State & Services** | `StateManager`, `AutoSaveManager`, `CollaborationSystem`, and other classes inside `CleanIntegratedScreenplayEditor.tsx` encapsulate local domain logic. |
| **AI Agents** | Configuration-heavy modules in `src/agents/` define task-specific personas and prompts that are orchestrated through Gemini (`geminiService.ts`). |
| **Types & Config** | Shared enums and interfaces in `src/types/` plus centralized agent registries in `src/config/`. |
| **Assets & Styling** | Tailwind-powered styling pipeline with additional editor-specific CSS in `src/style.css`. |

## Getting Started

1. **Install prerequisites**
   - [Node.js 18+](https://nodejs.org/) (which ships with npm)

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Run the development server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   By default Vite serves the app at [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173). The terminal will display the exact URL.

4. **Build for production**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```
   The optimized bundle is emitted to `dist/` and can be previewed with `npm run preview`.

## Development Scripts

| Command | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `npm run dev` | Launches the hot-reloading development server. |
| `npm run build` | Type-checks the project and generates an optimized production build. |
| `npm run preview` | Serves the production bundle locally for smoke testing. |

> **Testing & Linting**: The repository currently does not ship automated tests or lint scripts. When adding them, prefer `vitest` for unit tests and `eslint` + `prettier` for consistent authoring.

## Environment Configuration

Some AI functionality requires a Gemini API key at runtime:

- Create a `.env.local` file at the project root.
- Add `API_KEY=<your_google_generative_ai_key>`.
- Restart the dev server after updating environment variables.

The application gracefully degrades when a key is absent; AI features will surface informative error messages.

## Using the Editor

1. **Drafting Basics**
   - Type directly into the central editing surface. Formatting updates automatically based on detected screenplay cues.
   - Use **Tab** / **Shift+Tab** to cycle between action, character, dialogue, and transition blocks.
   - Apply rich text commands with familiar shortcuts (`Ctrl+B`, `Ctrl+I`, `Ctrl+U`).

2. **Toolbars & Panels**
   - **Top toolbar** exposes file, edit, format, and tools menus along with theme toggles.
   - **Right sidebar** controls fonts, sizes, quick insert shortcuts, document statistics, search/replace dialogs, and AI helpers.

3. **Search & Replace**
   - Invoke search via the binoculars icon or shortcuts, then apply regex-enabled queries to locate dialogue or action lines.

4. **Character Management**
   - Rename characters globally from the sidebar dialog to maintain naming consistency across long drafts.

5. **AI Review**
   - Open the AI review panel to trigger an automated critique. The current implementation simulates responses; integrating the real Gemini backend requires a valid API key.

## AI Agent Platform

- Agent blueprints live in `src/agents/` and are grouped by category (core, analysis, generation, evaluation, transformation).
- The Gemini service (`src/agents/core/geminiService.ts`) assembles persona prompts, attaches uploaded documents, and calls the Google Generative AI SDK.
- Customize agent behaviour by editing the corresponding instruction files under `src/agents/instructions/`.
